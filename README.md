# OpenPathCL
Route planing based on Open Street Map data. Parallelized with OpenCL.

## What this is about
This project was part of a portfolio exam in the Parallel Systems module at the Nordakademie.
The task was to implement two route planning algorithms in C, one serial and one parallel, and to compare their performance.

## Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses the OpenCL, Libcurl and cJSON libraries. They must be installed to use this project.

> [!NOTE]
> This code has only been tested on macOS. It may need to be adapted to run on your platform.
