# OpenPathCL

Route planing based on Open Street Map data. Parallelized with OpenCL.


## Background

This project was part of a portfolio exam in the Parallel Systems module at the Nordakademie.
The task was to implement two route planning algorithms in C, one serial and one parallel, and to compare their performance.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses the OpenCL, Libcurl and cJSON libraries. They must be installed to use this project.

> [!NOTE]
> This code has only been tested on macOS. It may need to be adapted to run on your platform.


## How it Works

The route planning process is broken down into four essential steps:


### Step 1: Getting the Data

The data required for route planning is sourced from the [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/), a powerful tool 
that allows users to query and extract specific geographic data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. 
The Overpass API provides flexible queries to retrieve **nodes** and **ways** (roads) within a bounding box, 
which is defined using the user-provided start and end coordinates.

In OSM, roads are represented as **ways** â€” a sequence of nodes, where each node corresponds to a geographical point 
with specific latitude and longitude coordinates. These nodes define the road's shape and structure.

Once the data is retrieved, it is parsed and stored in two arrays of structs: 
one for **nodes** (vertices) and one for **roads** (edges). Nodes represent the points, and roads connect these points.


### Step 2: Constructing the Graph

After parsing the data, it is converted into a graph representation so that algorithms can be run on it. 
The graph is modeled as an `n x n` adjacency matrix, where `n` represents the total number of nodes.

- Each node corresponds to a vertex in the graph.
- Roads provide the information needed to define edges between the nodes (vertices).
- If a node is part of a road, an edge exists between that node and the next node along the road. 
  This edge is bidirectional, meaning it represents two-way movement.

The [Haversine algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) is used to calculate the distance between 
two nodes, and this distance serves as the weight of the edge connecting them. 
These weights are stored in the [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) at the appropriate 
indices for the connected nodes.


### Step 3: Calculating the shortest distance

The shortest path between two nodes is calculated using a *Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP)* algorithm.

- For the *serial* implementation, the [Dijkstra algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 
  is employed to find the shortest path.
- In the *parallel* implementation, [Delta-Stepping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_single-source_shortest_path_algorithm), 
  a parallelized version of Dijkstra's algorithm, is used for improved performance on larger graphs.

These algorithms work by progressively exploring nodes, calculating the minimal cumulative distance from the start node 
to the destination node, while updating the shortest known distances.


### Step 4: Displaying the Result

Once the shortest path is computed, the result is displayed in two ways:

- *Terminal Output*: The list of nodes forming the path is printed to the terminal, showing the sequence of nodes 
  traversed to reach the destination.
- *Map Display*: The path is also visualized on an interactive map using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), 
  a lightweight JavaScript library for displaying maps using OSM data. The map shows the path by plotting the geographic 
  coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each node along the computed route.

An HTML page with embedded JavaScript code is used to display the map, and the path is drawn by connecting the 
corresponding nodes on the map.
